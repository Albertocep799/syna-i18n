![Synapse Translation Program](https://cdn.staffs.es/assets/Synai18n-banne.png)
Collaboration program and contribution of translations to Synapse and related. Here you'll find the final translations and source files for the translations.

### Do you speak a special language that Synapse doesn't know? Don't be shy and show it off!
Currently our translation program requires you to have a **[Crowdin account](https://accounts.crowdin.com/login)**, as it's the main platform we use to manage translations.

### What's Crowdin?
Crowdin is a platform that we started to use in order to facilitate the translation of Synapse and it's ecosystem.

This repository has two objectives:
- Serve the translation files for Synapse and it's ecosystem.
- Expose the source files of the translations.

### Are you interested in being part of the Synapse translation program?
No need to request access or anything like that, just register with Crowdin and access our project, and voila!

#### Rewards?
If you actively participate in the Synapse translation program, you'll receive an exclusive role on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/E6JrWfeqkQ)** and special rewards depending on the time you have been with us.

#### Proofreader
If you are interested in the idea of being a Proofreader of a specific language, don't hesitate to let us know on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/E6JrWfeqkQ)**.
